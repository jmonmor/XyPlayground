== Misconfigurations

This directory contains examples of misconfigurations.

Please note that certain misconfigurations need access to an external system, for example via an api with an access token. This is not easy to provide in a goat-like project.

Add a directory for each misconfiguration, and then either `bad` / `good` directories, or files with `.bad` / `.good` suffixes in the filename, before the extension.
